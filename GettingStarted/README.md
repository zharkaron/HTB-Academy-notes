# Basic Tools
Daily Tools can be used are 
- SSH
- Netcat
- Tmux
- Vim

## Using SSH

Secure Shell(SSH) is a network protocol that its default port is 22 and its capable of using password authentication or it can be passwordless using **Public-key authentication** The way it can be used is like this:
```
zharkaron@[/htb]$ ssh zhark@10.10.10.10

zhark@removeHost's password: ********

zhark@remotehost#
```

## Using Netcat

Netcat, ncat, or nc, is the best thing to check out ports open on a ip address for example to figure out the version and service that the ip address has open for example:
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3
```

# Service Scanning
Step process when starting to explore a machine:
- Find Operating system
- Find available services
- Find Their open ports 

## Nmap

Nmap is a basic scanning target tool used to find the simple port, service, and os of a machine like this
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ nmap 10.129.42.253

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:07 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.42.253
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.19 seconds
```

Theres multiple arguments you can specify nmap to use like -sC this is to specify to give you more imformation about a machine, -sV instructs to perform a version scan for each service and -p- will tell nmap to scan all 65,535 TCP ports
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.42.253

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-25 16:18 EST

```

## Nmap Scripts

You can run multiple nmap scripts with -sC on a target but theres times where specifying what script to run would be better 
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ locate scripts/citrix

/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-brute-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-apps.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers-xml.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/citrix-enum-servers.nse
```
The way to use a script is like **nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>**.

## Banner Grabing
banner grabing is a useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly. Often a service will look to identify itself by displaying a banner once a connection is initiated so nmap would try to grab banners with this **nmap -sV --script=banner** and you can use both netcat or nmap to figure out what service its using such as **nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21** or **nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24

## FTP

So right now we are going to be using the service ftp as an example of how things work
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sC -sV -p21 10.129.42.253

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-20 00:54 GMT
Nmap scan report for 10.129.42.253

Its worth being familiar getting with ftp since its a standard protocol and it can always contain data as it shows right now that theres an Anonymous login  enabled so we can try connecting to it 
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ ftp -p 10.129.42.253

Connected to 10.129.42.253.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.129.42.253:user): anonymous
230 Login successful.

Using binary mode to transfer files.

ftp> ls
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,129,42,253,158,60).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxr-xr-x    2 ftp      ftp          4096 Feb 25 19:25 pub
226 Directory send OK.

ftp> cd pub
250 Directory successfully changed.

ftp> ls
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,129,42,253,182,129).
150 Here comes the directory listing.

226 Directory send OK.

226 Transfer complete.

ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.
```
So in here we logged in as anonymous, used the ls to see if there was anything here and moved to the pub directory ran ls again and pulled the login.txt file from it from the context of the login.txt we could continue and have more access to the system

```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ cat login.txt 

admin:ftp@dmin123
```

## SMB

SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol on winodws machines that provides many vectores for vertical or lateral movement. and is used to share sensitive data including credentials. running a nmap scritp will allow you get a more detailed smb report allowing you to see if you could be capable of perfoming a hard exploit on it 
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p445 10.10.10.40

```
Here the host has Windows 7 OS, and we can comfirst its vulnerable to EternalBlue. But thats for later as of right now we will look into the samba machine

```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ nmap -A -p445 10.129.42.253

## Shares

SMB allows users and administrators to share folders and make them accessible remotely by other users. A tool can enumarate and interact with smb shares is smbclient the -L specifies we want a list of available shares on the remote hosts and -N makes it so it dosent give you a password prompt

```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L \\\\10.129.42.253

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
	users           Disk      
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (gs-svcscan server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

So this reveals that theres a users shares.

```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ smbclient \\\\10.129.42.253\\users

Enter WORKGROUP\users's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

smb: \> ls
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED listing \*

smb: \> exit
```

ls command resulted in acced denied message showing that your not allowed to use guess access lets try using the credentials (**bob:Welcome1)
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users

Enter WORKGROUP\bob's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

smb: \> ls

smb: \bob\> get passwords.txt 
getting file \bob\passwords.txt of size 156 as passwords.txt (0.3 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.3 KiloBytes/sec)
```
Here we got the passwords.txt file allowing us to do much more later on

## SNMP

SNMP has 2 insefure versisons 1v and 2v using only plane text but it uses default community strings such as public and private and so we want to find the routing information, services bound and the versino installed softwware so we will do this
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 10.129.42.253 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0

iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "gs-svcscan"
```
This is to find the service running after wards we want to see if we will get anything else
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  10.129.42.253 

Timeout: No Response from 10.129.42.253
```
required us to use a password so we will just use **onesixtyone** to brute force the community strings using a dictionary file of common strings
```
zharkaron@htb[/htb]$ onesixtyone -c dict.txt 10.129.42.254

Scanning 1 hosts, 51 communities
10.129.42.254 [public] Linux gs-svcscan 5.4.0-66-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 27 22:54:38 UTC 2021 x86_64
